 # 📅 Day 1: Simple Calculator

A beginner-friendly calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using JavaScript.

---

## 📌 Objective

Build a Simple Calculator to strengthen understanding of:

- Variables & Data Types
- DOM Manipulation
- Input validation
- Conditional logic using `switch-case`

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts Practiced

- ✅ Variables & Data Types  
- ✅ Input handling (`string` vs `number`)  
- ✅ `parseFloat()` for type conversion  
- ✅ `isNaN()` for input validation  
- ✅ DOM manipulation (`getElementById`, `innerText`)  
- ✅ `switch-case` for handling operations

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User enters two numbers in input fields.  
2. User clicks an operation button (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
3. `calculate(operator)` function runs.  
4. Inputs are converted to numbers using `parseFloat()`.  
5. Operation is performed using a `switch-case`.  
6. Result is shown dynamically on the page.
